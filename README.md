# CrapMap - Sewage and Industrial Wastewater Impact on Drinking Water
## Team Shuigraph


### Product Description

**Sewage and Industrial Wastewater Impact**

CrapMap is an application designed to visualize how industrial wastewater and sewage emissions impact the quality of water at drinking inlets. This platform helps users understand areas where water pollution is threatening drinking water sources, using environmental datasets for sewage emissions, industrial wastewater, and water quality.

### Product Pitch

**Introducing CrapMap: A Simple, Effective Tool for Visualizing Water Pollution!**

Clean drinking water is a fundamental necessity, yet industrial wastewater and sewage emissions pose significant risks to water sources. CrapMap provides a clear, interactive solution to monitor and visualize these impacts. This map-based application offers users a comprehensive view of how pollution affects water quality, allowing them to pinpoint areas where drinking water is most at risk.

Through CrapMap, users can view interactive maps displaying pollution sources, overlay pollution data over time, filter results based on pollutants, and track pollution severity in specific regions. By offering a user-friendly way to visualize and analyze water quality data, CrapMap empowers communities and environmental professionals to make informed decisions about water safety.

### Target Users

This application is targeted towards various users/groups. This includes...

* Environmental Researchers
   * Allow researchers to gain a deeper understanding of at-risk areas, and how pollution in these inlets has progressed over an extended period 
* Local Communities
   * Know what's safe for recreational activities.
* Communities at risk
   * Be knowledgeable on trends and patterns with Pollution to ensure safety for its residents. 

### Application Scope

The primary objective of CrapMap is to develop and deploy a functional prototype of a map-based pollution tracking tool. The development will prioritize key user stories and features based on their importance. While not all features may be completed, the focus will be on delivering core functionality, including:

- **Interactive Pollution Map**: A map that shows real pollution data from lakes and industrial sources.

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and overlays that display pollution severity and trends.

- **Pollution History**: Ability to view historical data on pollution levels for specific regions.

- **Custom Filtering**: Filters for pollutant type, location, and time period to focus on specific concerns.

- **Favorites and Highlights**: Users can favourite lakes or regions to easily access pollution data relevant to them.
